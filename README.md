# 📘 PDF Chat Application (RAG with Highlighted Sources)

This project is a **Streamlit-based PDF Question Answering app** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
You can upload a PDF, ask questions about its content, and get **short, accurate answers** generated by **Gemini**, along with **highlighted source chunks** from the PDF.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload any PDF file
- 🔍 Semantic search using **FAISS**
- 🧠 Text embeddings via **HuggingFace (MiniLM)**
- 🤖 Answer generation using **Google Gemini**
- 🖍️ Highlighted source chunks with page numbers
- ⚡ Cached vector store for fast performance
- ❌ Responds with *"I don't know"* if answer is not in the PDF
- 🧾 Stores Chat History

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** – UI
- **LangChain** – Orchestration & document processing
- **FAISS** – Vector database
- **HuggingFace Embeddings** – Semantic text embeddings
- **Google Gemini** – Answer generation
- **PyPDFLoader** – PDF extraction

## 🧠 How It Works

- Upload a PDF – Use the file uploader widget
- PDF Processing – Document is split into overlapping chunks (800 chars, 150 char overlap)
- Embeddings – Chunks are converted into embeddings using HuggingFace MiniLM
- Vector Store – Embeddings are stored in FAISS for fast retrieval
- Query Processing – User question retrieves top-3 relevant chunks
- Answer Generation – Gemini generates an answer strictly from retrieved context
- Source Display – Original chunks are shown with page numbers and highlighting

## 🧪 Example Prompts

Try asking these questions after uploading a PDF:

- "What is the main topic discussed in this PDF?"
- "Summarize the key points"
- "What does the document say about [specific topic]?"
- "Who are the authors?"

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Accuracy & Grounding

- ✅ Answers are strictly grounded in PDF context
- ✅ No hallucinations – If information is missing, the app responds with "I don't know"
- ❌ Does not generate information outside the PDF content

### PDF Compatibility

- ✅ Works best with text-based PDFs
- ❌ May struggle with scanned images (OCR not included)

### Performance

- Vector stores are cached for faster repeated queries
- First query may take a few seconds while embeddings are computed
